Quiz 3

<p> This is my quiz three submission. 
I changed the basemap, added links to the navbar that work, and also added a .png picture to the navbar. 
I also added in some census data and was in the process of making a mouseover event for population density
and a choropleth, but was unable to do to time constraints. There is some spatial data included (a simplified
US states polygon feature) so I hope that this works for the assignment.
